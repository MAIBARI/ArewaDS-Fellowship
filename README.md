Markdown Tutorial for Beginners

Headings
Headings are created by adding one or more # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

#Emphasis
You can emphasize text with bold or italic formatting.

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_


#Lists
Unordered Lists: You can make an unordered list by preceding list items with either a -, *, or +.

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b

Ordered Lists: Ordered lists are created using numbers:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   2. Item 3b

#Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping the link text in brackets [ ] and then the URL in parentheses ( ).

#Images
Images are similar to links, but they require an exclamation point in front, and the text inside the brackets is the alt text.

#Code and Syntax Highlighting
Inline code: Use backticks code for inline code.
Code blocks: Use triple backticks (```) or indent code with four spaces for blocks.
You can use backticks to create code blocks. For syntax highlighting, specify the language after the first set of backticks.

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```
```
