Markdown Tutorial for Beginners
Welcome to this beginner-friendly tutorial on Markdown. This guide will introduce you to Markdown, a simple way to format text using plain text syntax.

Markdown is widely used for writing formatted text on the web and is particularly popular in software development for documentation, README files, and commenting on issues and pull requests.

Introduction to Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax.

Why Use Markdown?
Simplicity: Easy to write and read without needing complex formatting tools.
Portability: Markdown can be converted to many formats like HTML, PDF, and Word.
Compatibility: Works on various platforms and integrates seamlessly with many software applications.
Basic Syntax
Below are some of the most commonly used Markdown syntax elements.

Headings
Headings are created by adding one or more # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
Emphasis
You can emphasize text with bold or italic formatting.

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
Lists
Unordered Lists: You can make an unordered list by preceding list items with either a -, *, or +.

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b

Ordered Lists: Ordered lists are created using numbers:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   2. Item 3b

Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ).

Images
Images are similar to links, but they require an exclamation point in front, and the text inside the brackets is the alt text.

Code and Syntax Highlighting
Inline code: Use backticks code for inline code.
Code blocks: Use triple backticks (```) or indent code with four spaces for blocks.
You can use backticks to create code blocks. For syntax highlighting, specify the language after the first set of backticks.

print("Hello, world!")

Tables
Use pipes | and dashes - to create tables.

| Name         | Role          | Department       |
|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| John Doe     | Instructor    | Data Science     |
| Jane Smith   | Student       | Machine Learning |
Task Lists
Use - [ ] for an unchecked box and - [x] for a checked box.
- [x] Complete Markdown lecture
- [ ] Prepare assignments
- [ ] Review student submissions
Horizontal Rule
You can create a horizontal rule with three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores.
